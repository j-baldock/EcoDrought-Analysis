<h2 data-number="7.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sensitivity-analysis"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Sensitivity analysis</h2>
<p>Many of the EcoDrought time series data are incomplete. At some sites, discharge data is available only during the summer and/or fall periods, and at other sites, time series data are interrupted due to malfunctioning sensors and/or ice formation (“ice spikes”). So how does the length of the time series affect baseflow separation (and subsequent event identification)? Wasko and Guo (2022) use a 67 day time series of flow to demonstrate the utility of the <em>hydroEvents</em> packages, suggesting digital baseflow separation techniques may be valid for relatively short time series.</p>
<p>Here, I perform a simple sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of time series length on the results of baseflow separation. Essentially, perform baseflow separation on increasingly smaller subsets of the data. With the default parameters, the minimum number of days/observations needed is 31. This is because the default number of points reflected at start and end of data (r) is 30. Reflection allows bf/bfi to be calculated over the entire period of record as the underlying baseflow separation equations result in “issues of”Warm-up” and “cool-down” as the recursive filter is moved forward and backward over the dataset” (Ladson et al.&nbsp;2013, Australian Journal of Water Resources). <em>baseflowB()</em> uses a default reflection period of 30, which Ladson et al.&nbsp;(2013) found to “provide a realistic baselfow response for the start and end of the actual flow data”.</p>

<p>The story here is essentially the same as above: divergence is ~minimal and restricted to the end of each time series. However, we note that divergence in BFI appears to increase as absolute flow/baseflow decreases, because small differences in absolute space become much larger in relative space when absolute values are small.</p>

<p>Perform baseflow separation. See Wasko and Guo (2022, Hydrological Processes) for recommendations on parameterization, as different algorithms and alpha values can produce different results. Section 4.1: “…users should not simply use recommended filter parameter values from literature in combination with any baseflow filter code without verification of their choice of filter parameter. As the digital baseflow filter is not tied to any physical realism (Nathan and McMahon, 1990) and a larger fractional baseflow may aid identification of events—even if this is not strictly baseflow as per its definition (Linsley et al., 1958)…”.</p>
<p>It is not actually necessary to do this separately, as baseflow separation is conducted in the event delineation function internally. But it is helpful to view the results and explore how different parameterizations yield different baseflow contributions.</p>

<p>There are multiple options for methods of event identification. Section 4.2 in Wasko and Guo (2022): It can be generalized that, if the aim of the analysis is to identify independent streamflow maxima then eventMaxima() and eventMinima() work well and indeed have been traditionally employed for this task. If identifying independent small events becomes difficult, or the aim is to identify wet spells, eventBaseflow() may be preferred.” In our case, small events are likely important, so we use eventBaseflow() with a ~large values for BFI_Th to capture those small events.</p>
<p>The aim is to understand how water availability affects differences in yield between Big G and Little g during hydrologic events and the intervening periods (non-event baseflow periods). Therefore, we identify events from the Big G data, apply event/non-event time periods to the little g data, then explore G-g deviations during both events and non-events as a function of</p>
<p>Separate Big G and Little G data</p>

<p><strong><em>Question</em></strong>: How does water availability affect <em>upstream</em> diversity in streamflow regimes? How does this manifest as heterogeneity <strong><em>within</em></strong> and <strong><em>among</em></strong> locations in the upstream river network?</p>
<p>Based on results above, there does not appear to be any significant difference in the G-g relationship for event and non-event periods. Therefore, do not include random intercepts/slopes (by event/non-event) in the model. Previously, I tried to estimate the G-g differences using an intercept model, with the magnitude of difference a function of water availability. However, when Q = Qg, this simplified to a linear regression between Qg (dependent var.) and QG (independent var.), which is ultimately what is of interest. I estimate this regression model below:</p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="slope-int.-correlation">Slope-int. correlation</h5>
<p>Slopes and intercepts are negatively correlated (this is not unexpected, and explains the attenuation). If we wanted to predict new sites (to understand the “complete” range of G-g response), would need to add a slope-intercept correlation structure to the model (pgs. 362 and 376 in Gelman and Hill, 2007). As noted in Gelman and Hill, the strength of the correlation between slopes and intercepts is sensitive to how the data is centered (or not). Currently, data span 0 (in log space), so this isn’t really an artifact of the issues mentioned in Gelman and Hill (although if we mean centered the data this relationship does weaken slightly). It may actually make the most sense to force the intercept to be at the lowest value of log(G) (i.e., add min(log(G)) to all data, G and g). Intercepts would then represent the maximum expected variation in g during periods of lowest water availability.</p>

<p>Here, I plot the effect of Big G yield on global (i.e., among-site) variation in little g. How does among-site variation in little g response to big G attenuate with increasing Big G? Note that this is a derived relationship: the standard deviation of posterior predicted mean g among sites. Also note that this only considers the sites we have data for, not all possible locations in the river network. This could potentially be achieved by simulating data for new sites (see pg. 362 in Gelman and Hill, 2007), but would likely need to add slope-intercept correlation structure to the model to ensure that attenuation in preserved (see pg. 376 in Gelman and Hill).</p>

<p>We can visualize this another way, as site-specific differences between little g and Big G at different levels of water availability/Big G flow. This is ~equivalent to the plot above, but provides a site-level examination of Qg variation around QG and how those change over the range of Big G flow.</p>

<p>How much among-site variation in little G response to Big G might we expect assuming homogeneity in flow regimes? This is the null hypotheses. Although I’m not sure this is the proper way to do this…for each of n sites, I randomly sample from the posterior distributions of alpha.mu and beta.mu to generate site-specific relationships that all follow the global parameters/relationships.</p>

<p>There are probably better ways to do this, but here I’m quantifying/visualizing what I’m calling “portfolio strength”, or the degree of heterogeneity in streamflow regimes across the network, as a function of water availability (big G flow). Portfolio strength is calculated as the (median) observed among-site variation in little G divided by the (median) expected/simulated among site variation in little g assuming flow homogeneity. Thus, values &gt;1 and &lt;1 indicate greater and less heterogeneity in streamflow than expected under the assumption of homogeneity, respectively. I think this would be a good way to compare/standardize among basins.</p>

<p>Alternatively, portfolio strength can be defined as the ratio between among-site variation in little g at low vs.&nbsp;high values of Big G (sensu Chezik et al.&nbsp;2017)…so we get distributions for observed and expected values, where a value of 1 indicates no portfolio behavior (no streamflow diversity at different levels of Big G). I don’t think this makes sense because the whole point is the evaluation how diversity in flow regimes (i.e., portfolio strength) changes with water availability.</p>

<span id="cb58-65"><a href="#cb58-65" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Many of the EcoDrought time series data are incomplete. At some sites, discharge data is available only during the summer and/or fall periods, and at other sites, time series data are interrupted due to malfunctioning sensors and/or ice formation ("ice spikes"). So how does the length of the time series affect baseflow separation (and subsequent event identification)? Wasko and Guo (2022) use a 67 day time series of flow to demonstrate the utility of the *hydroEvents* packages, suggesting digital baseflow separation techniques may be valid for relatively short time series. </span>
<span id="cb58-66"><a href="#cb58-66" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb58-67"><a href="#cb58-67" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Here, I perform a simple sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of time series length on the results of baseflow separation. Essentially, perform baseflow separation on increasingly smaller subsets of the data. With the default parameters, the minimum number of days/observations needed is 31. This is because the default number of points reflected at start and end of data (r) is 30. Reflection allows bf/bfi to be calculated over the entire period of record as the underlying baseflow separation equations result in "issues of "Warm-up" and "cool-down" as the recursive filter is moved forward and backward over the dataset" (Ladson et al. 2013, Australian Journal of Water Resources). *baseflowB()* uses a default reflection period of 30, which Ladson et al. (2013) found to "provide a realistic baselfow response for the start and end of the actual flow data".</span>

Section 4.1: "...users should not simply use recommended filter parameter values from literature in combination with any baseflow filter code without verification of their choice of filter parameter. As the digital baseflow filter is not tied to any physical realism (Nathan and McMahon, 1990) and a larger fractional baseflow may aid identification of events—even if this is not strictly baseflow as per its definition (Linsley et al., 1958)...".</span>

<span id="cb58-158"><a href="#cb58-158" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>There are multiple options for methods of event identification. Section 4.2 in Wasko and Guo (2022): It can be generalized that, if the aim of the analysis is to identify independent streamflow maxima then eventMaxima() and eventMinima() work well and indeed have been traditionally employed for this task. If identifying independent small events becomes difficult, or the aim is to identify wet spells, eventBaseflow() may be preferred." In our case, small events are likely important, so we use eventBaseflow() with a ~large values for BFI_Th to capture those small events.</span>

Therefore, we identify events from the Big G data, apply event/non-event time periods to the little g data, then explore G-g deviations during both events and non-events as a function of </span>

<span id="cb58-315"><a href="#cb58-315" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Based on results above, there does not appear to be any significant difference in the G-g relationship for event and non-event periods. Therefore, do not include random intercepts/slopes (by event/non-event) in the model. Previously, I tried to estimate the G-g differences using an intercept model, with the magnitude of difference a function of water availability. However, when Q = Qg, this simplified to a linear regression between Qg (dependent var.) and QG (independent var.), which is ultimately what is of interest. I estimate this regression model below:</span>

<span id="cb58-493"><a href="#cb58-493" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Slopes and intercepts are negatively correlated (this is not unexpected, and explains the attenuation). If we wanted to predict new sites (to understand the "complete" range of G-g response), would need to add a slope-intercept correlation structure to the model (pgs. 362 and 376 in Gelman and Hill, 2007). As noted in Gelman and Hill, the strength of the correlation between slopes and intercepts is sensitive to how the data is centered (or not). Currently, data span 0 (in log space), so this isn't really an artifact of the issues mentioned in Gelman and Hill (although if we mean centered the data this relationship does weaken slightly). It may actually make the most sense to force the intercept to be at the lowest value of log(G) (i.e., add min(log(G)) to all data, G and g). Intercepts would then represent the maximum expected variation in g during periods of lowest water availability. </span>

<span id="cb58-635"><a href="#cb58-635" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Here, I plot the effect of Big G yield on global (i.e., among-site) variation in little g. How does among-site variation in little g response to big G attenuate with increasing Big G? Note that this is a derived relationship: the standard deviation of posterior predicted mean g among sites. Also note that this only considers the sites we have data for, not all possible locations in the river network.

Portfolio strength is calculated as the (median) observed among-site variation in little G divided by the (median) expected/simulated among site variation in little g assuming flow homogeneity. Thus, values &gt;1 and &lt;1 indicate greater and less heterogeneity in streamflow than expected under the assumption of homogeneity, respectively.

<span id="cb58-748"><a href="#cb58-748" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Alternatively, portfolio strength can be defined as the ratio between among-site variation in little g at low vs. high values of Big G (sensu Chezik et al. 2017)...so we get distributions for observed and expected values, where a value of 1 indicates no portfolio behavior (no streamflow diversity at different levels of Big G). I don't think this makes sense because the whole point is the evaluation how diversity in flow regimes (i.e., portfolio strength) changes with water availability.</span>
