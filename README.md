# EcoDrought-Analysis

This repository contains code for the USGS Eco-Drought Capstone Project. Our goals are to (1) quantify fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in flow regimes in headwater stream networks, (2) demonstrate the limitations of existing tools that model flow in headwater streams, and (3) assess the subsequent effects of streamflow heterogeneity on fish population dynamics and vulnerability to climatic variation, particularly drought.
