# EcoDrought-Analysis
This repository contains code for the USGS Eco-Drought Project. Our goals are to (1) quantify fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in flow regimes in headwater stream networks and (2) assess the subsequent effects of streamflow heterogeneity on fish population dynamics and vulnerability to climatic variation, particularly drought.
